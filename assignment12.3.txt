1.Explain the uses of NoSQL Databases in brief and list the current NoSQL databases which are available.
When compared to relational databases, NoSQL databases are more scalable and provide superior performance, and their data model addresses several issues that the relational model is not designed to address:
Large volumes of rapidly changing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
Agile sprints, quick schema iteration, and frequent code pushes
Object-oriented programming that is easy to use and flexible
Geographically distributed scale-out architecture instead of expensive, monolithic architecture
Current NoSQL databases which are available:
*Accumulo
*Cassandra
*Druid
*HBase
*Vertica
*SAP HANA

2.Explain the Differences between Hive and HBase in Brief with examples.Answer:

*Apache Hive is a data warehouse infrastructure built on top of Hadoop. It allows for querying data stored on HDFS for analysis via HQL, an SQL-like language that gets translated to MapReduce jobs. Despite providing SQL functionality, Hive does not provide interactive querying yet - it only runs batch processes on Hadoop.

*Apache HBase is a NoSQL key/value store which runs on top of HDFS. Unlike Hive, HBase operations run in real-time on its database rather than MapReduce jobs. HBase is partitioned to tables, and tables are further split into column families. Column families, which must be declared in the schema, group together a certain set of columns (columns don’t require schema definition). For example, the "message" column family may include the columns: "to", "from", "date", "subject", and "body". Each key/value pair in HBase is defined as a cell, and each key consists of row-key, column family, column, and time-stamp. A row in HBase is a grouping of key/value mappings identified by the row-key. HBase enjoys Hadoop’s infrastructure and scales horizontally using off the shelf servers.
